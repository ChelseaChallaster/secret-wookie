Food Truck Predictor:

	Code written in R that projects the likelihood of food trucks per state, based on income, population, 
	and shopping preferences. Using discriminate functional analysis and linear regression, I found a 
	linear correlation between these factors and mapped them. I'm sure this could be downscaled to a county 
	level. 
	
	This data will be useful over the next few years as population/income changes in each state, causing 
	the preference for	food trucks to change with time.
